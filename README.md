# Prediction-of-House-s-Price-Using-Logistic-Regression-
An accurate prediction of the house price is important to prospective homeowners, developers, investors, appraisers, tax assessors and other real estate market participants, such as, mortgage lenders and insurers. Traditional house price prediction is based on cost and sale price comparison lacking of an accepted standard and a certification process. Therefore, the availability of a house price prediction model helps fill up an important information gap and improve the efficiency of the real estate market. In our project we use different attributes to predict house price.
